LYDIA DEVELOPER INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

For the purposes of this document, a Lydia developer is defined
as someone with access to the Lydia Subversion Repository.

If you are such a developer, the instructions for compiling the
sources require one additional first step with respect to the
conventional instructions. This step will cause the ./configure
script to be generated.

This is done by executing:

	./bootstrap

at the top level Lydia directory. After that, just say

	./configure

as usual, and proceed from there.

(During the bootstrap, you may see a number of 'm4' warnings
mentioning 'underquoted definition of <foo>'. These are an
artifact of your Linux distribution and can be safely
disregarded.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

As developer, you can always just execute:

	./bootstrap clean

if you solely want to get rid of all the generated files. (Always
make sure that you do not add any generated files to the
repository!)

If you want to generate a tarball for distribution purposes, say:

	make dist

and files called 'lydia-<versionnumber>.tar.gz' and
'lydia-<versionnumber>.zip' will be generated in the top level
directory.

These files can be distributed: they contain no CVS-related
directories, nor any files/directories not immediately related to
the primary lydia sources. The 'configure' script *is* included,
so people should be able to compile and install their version of
Lydia in the familiar way.

Nevertheless, we should be careful about distributing such
development tarballs too often or too widely -- they are mostly
for our own convenience. Proper Lydia releases for outside
distribution will undoubtedly happen one day soon.
