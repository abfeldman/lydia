This directory contains the sources for a Lydia compiler.

The language Lydia is used to describe the behaviour of physical systems,
and in particular their behaviour under the assumption of defects in the
system. These system models are used to generate code for error
identification and diagnosis, and related applications.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tm Template Manager software is being phased out, but for now
needs to be installed in order to use Lydia. The most recent
version of Tm as of this writing is version 2.1.0, available
from:

    <https://gforge.cs.vu.nl/projects/templatemanager>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other prerequisities: 

Lydia requires: 

- autoconf v2.58a or higher
- automake v2.7 or higher

Running the test suite (*strongly* recommended) requires:

- python 2.4 or higher

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the compiler it is usually sufficient to issue the following
commands:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/lydia
    make all check install
    rehash

This will configure the sources for your particular system,
compile the Lydia compiler, run a set of validation tests on it,
and install a `lydia' executable in the directory
$HOME/lydia/bin. The `rehash' command makes sure that the
installed executable is also found by your shell, and is only
necessary if you are running a C-Shell derivative (e.g. csh or
tcsh).

(If you are compiling Lydia from sources obtained directly from
the Subversion repository rather than from an official release
archive, you need to explicitly generate the 'configure' script
first. Please refer to the file README-DEVELOPERS for
instructions.)

    ./configure --help 

will list possible custom options to 'configure' that are yet to
be documented in this README.

If the python 2.4 executable is not in your search path (this can
be the case e.g. on Debian systems), provide the correct location
as follows:

    ./configure PYTHON=/some/location/python2.4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can uninstall the Lydia compiler again with:

    make uninstall

in this directory.

Obviously, you can also have it installed in another directory by changing
the value that you give to the --prefix option of the configure script.

Assuming that the directory $HOME/lydia/bin is your search path, you can
now invoke the compiler as follows:

    lydia hello.sys

There actually is a file hello.sys in the distribution. For this file
the lydia compiler will produce the following output:

system hello(s:int) = {
    s = 42
}

Options
-------

Optionally, the readline library can be used to allow more comfortable
editing of commandlines in `spock'. To enable this feature, give 
configure the option

 --enable-readline



Flags
-----

The command

    lydia -h

shows the command-line options of Lydia.  The most useful are:

-c		Reorder the simplified system, and generate C code for it.
-dn		Trace expression simplification.
