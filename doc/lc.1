.SH DESCRIPTION
Compile a Lydia model. Lydia is a language and a tool-set for
model-based diagnosis, but can be used for solving a range of AI
problems as well.  The purpose of the Lydia compiler is to translate
the input Lydia model to an internal representation, in which
type-checking has been done, the arrays are expanded and the data
structures can be further converted to a number of normal forms.
.PP
If SOURCE is not specified, model will be read from standard input. If
DEST is not specified the compiled model will be sent to standard output.
